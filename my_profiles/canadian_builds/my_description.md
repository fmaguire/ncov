A series of custom Canadian builds highlighting Nova Scotia and Ontario sequences
currently openly available in GISAID. 

This acts as a showcase to demonstrate the utility of applying this augur/auspice
approach to all provincial data including those not currently released.

This visualisation can be rendered locally or behind a controlled access web-server
helping to avoid issues of data-access/privacy.
